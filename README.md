## Overview

This Python library provides an implementation of the Morlet wavelet
transform, a powerful time-frequency analysis method that offers an
intuitive approach to understanding signal characteristics. The
implementation is inspired by the pioneering work of [French geophysicist
Jean Morlet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Morlet), leveraging his
original, highly intuitive formulation which laid the foundation for the
Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT).

Unlike more abstract modern formulations of the CWT, Jean Morlet's method is
deeply rooted in physical intuition, making it particularly accessible for
comprehending how signals vary in frequency over time.

## Features

- **Intuitive Implementation**: Directly implements Morlet's original and
  physically intuitive formulation of the wavelet transform, as detailed in
  his 1982 papers.
- **High Performance**: Supports computations on both the CPU and GPU,
  enabling efficient processing of large datasets and high-frequency signals.
- **Pythonic Design**: Developed as a user-friendly Python library, making it
  accessible for researchers and developers.

## Installation

If you use `uv` as your Python package manager, you can install Morvex using
the following command:

```bash
# Install as a Git dependency source using `uv` (recommended)
$ uv add git+https://github.com/nimanzik/Morvex
```

If you prefer to use `pip`, you need to install it from source:

```bash
# Install from source using `pip`
$ git clone https://github.com/nimanzik/Morvex.git
$ cd Morvex
$ pip install .
```

## Usage

To compute the scalogram (the output of the CWT):

```python
import numpy as np

from morvex import MorletFilterBank

data = ... # some signal data
fs = ...   # sampling frequency of the signal

filter_bank = MorletFilterBank(
    n_octaves=8,          # Number of octaves to cover
    n_intervals=4,        # Number of intervals (filters) per octave
    shape_ratio=5,        # Shape ratio of the Morlet wavelet
    duration=2.0,         # Duration of the Morlet wavelet
    sampling_freq=fs,     # Sampling frequency of the signal
    array_engine="cupy",  # Choices: "numpy" or "cupy"
)

mode = "magnitude"        # Choices: "magnitude", "power", "complex"
scalogram = filter_bank.transform(data, mode=mode, detach_from_device=True)
```

### Switching between CPU and GPU

Switching between CPU and GPU computation is as simple as changing the
`array_engine` parameter to either `"numpy"` or `"cupy"`.

- For CPU computation (and storing the results as NumPy arrays):

    ```python
    filter_bank = MorletFilterBank(..., array_engine="numpy")
    ```

- For GPU computation (and storing the results as CuPy arrays):

    ```python
    filter_bank = MorletFilterBank(..., array_engine="cupy")
    ```

### Use CuPy for computation but get results as NumPy array

When using GPU for computation, the results will be returned as so-called
"device arrays". To move the results to the host (CPU) memory, use the
`detach_from_device` parameter:

```python
filter_bank = MorletFilterBank(..., array_engine="cupy")
scalogram_as_numpy = filter_bank.transform(..., detach_from_device=True)
```

By default, the `detach_from_device` parameter is set to `False`, meaning
the results will be stored as device arrays when using GPU for computation
(note that it has no effect on CPU computation).

### Use CuPy for computation and get results as PyTorch Tensor

Both PyTorch and CuPy support `__cuda_array_interface__`, so zero-copy data
exchange between CuPy and PyTorch can be achieved at no cost.

The only requirement is that the tensor must be already on GPU before
exchanging data. Therefore, make sure that `detach_from_device=False`
(which is the default behavior) when doing the transformation.

PyTorch supports zero-copy data exchange through `DLPack`, so you can get
the results as a PyTorch tensor as follows:

```python
import torch

filter_bank = MorletFilterBank(..., array_engine="cupy")
scalogram_as_cupy = filter_bank.transform(..., detach_from_device=False)
scalogram_as_torch = torch.from_dlpack(scalogram_as_cupy)
```

### Visualisation

There are quick-and-ready methods to visualise both the filter bank and the
computed scalogram.

- To visualise the scalogram:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

fig_sgram, ax_sgram = plt.subplots()
filter_bank.plot_scalogram(ax=ax_sgram, scalogram=scalogram)
```

- To visualise the frequency responses of the filter bank:

```python
fig_fbank, ax_fbank = plt.subplots()
filter_bank.plot_responses(ax=ax_fbank, n_fft=512)
```

Here is an example of the computed scalogram for a signal with a sampling
frequency of 16 kHz:

| Example Signal | Morlet Filter Bank | Computed scalogram |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ![Example Signal](docs/assets/images/01_example_signal.png) | ![Morlet Filter Bank](docs/assets/images/02_filter_bank.png) | ![Computed scalogram](docs/assets/images/03_scalogram.png) |

## Shape Ratio ($\kappa$)

A significant innovation introduced by Morlet is the **shape ratio**, $\kappa$.
This parameter defines the Gaussian time width at half-amplitude as an integer
multiple of the wavelet's dominant period ($\Delta t = \kappa T_0$). This
allows for the preservation of the wavelet's shape as its dominant period
changes, providing a consistent analysis across frequencies.

## Examples

[This example](https://nimanzik.github.io/Morvex/assets/htmls/basic_example.html)
shows how to use `Morvex` to compute the wavelet transform of an acoustic
Fin-Whale signal. The [marimo notebook](examples/marimo_notebooks/basic_example.py)
for this example is also available for interactive exploration.
